# CS-210
Summarize the project and what it was solving.

	The goal of this project was to build a banking app that
 	demonstrates the power of investing and compound interest
  	using efficient and secure C++.
  

What did you do particularly well?

	I think my function for calculating yearly interest
 	accrual and account balance is well excecuted. Also, I
  	think my naming was in-line with best practices and easy
   	to follow.
  
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these imporvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

	The function that I am most happy with is also a sore point.
 	CurrBalNoDep() and CurrBalWDep() are fundamentally the same
  	function, with slight modifications to CurrBalWDep(), necessary
   	to include the monthly deposit amount in calculations. If I were
	to revisit this project, I would find a way to be less redundant
 	so the file and code could be more concise.
  
  
Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

	Writing the code that formatted the yearly accrual information
 	before it went to the vector was difficult. I needed to be able
  	to recall three int variables as one string with proper punctuation.
   	Eventually, I was able to mimick pointers I found online to suit my
	code. I don't think the site I found it was anything I especially
 	wanted to keep for future resource... in fact, it may have been a
  	mish-mash of information I found on different sites... but it worked!
   	When things work, I like to archive my code on my desktop for future
	reference when dealing with a hurdle.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

	This project stressed the importance of proper class building and
 	file management, which will only serve to improve the security and
  	efficiency of my code in the future. Also, I'm always thrilled to
   	find ways to pass tedious mathematical procedures off to a
	computer program.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

	The program is maintainable and readable because of the comments
 	I provided to clarify the code, as well as the organization of the
  	files, with the class declaration in the header file, the definitions
   	in a source file, and the main function remaining as minimal as
	possible. The program is adaptable because it is modularized. If
 	changes need to be made to a function, it would be easy enough to test
  	it outside of the program.
